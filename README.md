# GFR Prediction & Analysis Database

This repository hosts the comprehensive database and result sets for the prediction of **Glass Forming Range (GFR)** and the analysis of associated feature importance.

It specifically encompasses the input datasets and output results for two distinct modeling approaches:

*   **Composition-GFR**: Data and predictions based on chemical composition.
*   **Property-GFR**: Data and predictions based on physical and chemical properties.

## Contents

### Data
This database includes the necessary dataset required to replicate the GFR prediction models and feature analysis for both Composition-based and Property-based approaches.

### Out
The repository contains the output data derived from the models, including:
*   Model performance results.
*   SHAP analysis results.
